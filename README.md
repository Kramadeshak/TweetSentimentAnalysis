# TweetSentimentAnalysis

Part of the kaggle competition "To Classify Coronavirus Tweets During Covid-19"

## Objective:

To perform text classification of coronavirus tweets during the peak Covid - 19 period using LSTMs/RNNs/CNNs/BERT.

## Problem Statement

To build and implement a Recurrent Neural Network or a Convolutional Neural Network or any other Deep Learning model to perform text classification in a dataset consisting of approximately 45000 coronavirus tweets.

At the end of this competition, you will be able to:

1. Load the Coronavirus Dataset (train and test) and perform the pre-processing steps.
2. Build an RNN (Long Short Term Memory/Gated Recurrent Unit) or a Convolutional Neural Network or BERT (with/without 'attention') using either Keras or PyTorch deep learning libraries.
3. Evaluate the performance of your model using Categorization Accuracy as the metric.

## Description:

The tweets have been pulled from Twitter and manual tagging has been done.
The names and usernames have purposely been given codes to hide privacy.

## Columns:

1. UserName
2. ScreenName
3. Location
4. TweetAt
5. Original Tweet
6. Sentiment

## Approach

Tried extracting the unique locations so that it can be used in tweet analysis
